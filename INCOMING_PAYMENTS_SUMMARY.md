### The Complete Picture for Flats 1-3:

| Data Source | Flat 1 | Flat 2 | Flat 3 |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Historical INCOMING** | ✅ £5,565 | ✅ £4,440 | ✅ £4,440 |
| **PayProp INCOMING** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ None |
| **PayProp ICDN (Invoices)** | ✅ £5,565 | ✅ £5,180 | ✅ £4,440 |
| **PayProp COMMISSION** | ✅ £477 | ✅ £444 | ✅ £444 |

**What happened:**
1. Jan-Sep 2025: Rent tracked in historical_transactions (CSV imports)
2. Mid-2025: Properties added to PayProp for invoicing
3. PayProp started creating invoices (ICDN) + calculating commission
4. But PayProp NOT tracking actual rent receipts (still in historical system)
5. Result: **Hybrid setup** - invoices in PayProp, payments in historical

**This is why we saw commission without PayProp payments** - commission calculated from PayProp invoices, but actual rent receipts in historical data!

## Current State of unified_transactions

### From Historical Source:
- **Count:** 138 records
- **Total:** £106,288.00

### From PayProp Source:
- **Count:** 433 records (includes ICDN, BATCH, COMMISSION, INCOMING)
- **Total:** £188,935.82

**Note:** Historical total in unified (£106,288) is slightly higher than category='rent' (£104,968) because unified also includes some expenses/other categories with invoice linkage.

## Summary: Where to Find Incoming Rent

### Method 1: Individual Sources
```sql
-- PayProp incoming
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM financial_transactions
WHERE data_source = 'INCOMING_PAYMENT'
-- Result: £88,560.39

-- Historical incoming
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM historical_transactions
WHERE category = 'rent' AND amount > 0
-- Result: £104,968.00

-- Combined: £193,528.39
```

### Method 2: Unified View (After Rebuild)
```sql
-- After ICDN exclusion and rebuild
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM unified_transactions
WHERE source_system IN ('HISTORICAL', 'PAYPROP')
  AND payprop_data_source IN ('INCOMING_PAYMENT') OR source_system = 'HISTORICAL'
```

---

## Impact of ICDN Exclusion

### Current unified_transactions (WITH ICDN):
- HISTORICAL: 138 records, £106,288
- PAYPROP: 433 records, £188,936
- **Total: 571 records, £295,224**

### After ICDN exclusion (WITHOUT ICDN):
- HISTORICAL: 138 records, £106,288 (unchanged)
- PAYPROP: ~270 records, ~£76,027 (minus 163 ICDN records)
- **Total: ~408 records, ~£182,315**

**Removed:** ~163 ICDN invoice records (£112,909)

**Remaining in PAYPROP:**
- INCOMING_PAYMENT: 106 records, £88,560
- BATCH_PAYMENT: 152 records, £63,594
- COMMISSION_PAYMENT: 118 records, £12,432
- Total: ~376 PayProp cash flow records

---

## Recommendation

### For Statement Generation:

**Use unified_transactions AFTER:**
1. ✅ Excluding ICDN_ACTUAL (invoices)
2. ✅ Including INCOMING_PAYMENT (PayProp receipts)
3. ✅ Including category='rent' (historical receipts)
4. ✅ Including BATCH_PAYMENT (disbursements)
5. ✅ Including COMMISSION_PAYMENT (fees)

**This gives you:**
- All actual rent received (£193,528)
- All money paid out (£84,585)
- All commission charged (£14,002)
- **Pure cash flow** - no invoices/billing documents

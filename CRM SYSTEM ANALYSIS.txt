üîç COMPREHENSIVE CRM SYSTEM ANALYSIS REPORT
Original Problem Statement

User reported constant loading screen when clicking "maintenance history" button on property details page
URL: https://spoutproperty-hub.onrender.com/employee/ticket/property/2/maintenance-history
Controller method: TicketController.showPropertyMaintenanceHistory()


CRITICAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ISSUES DISCOVERED
1. DUAL CUSTOMER TABLE PROBLEM üö®
Your system has two separate customer tables with conflicting data:
TableRecordsStatusPrimary KeyPurposecustomer (singular)981 records‚úÖ Populatedcustomer_idActual customer datacustomers (plural)0 records‚ùå Emptycustomer_idUsed by property assignments
Impact: Property assignments reference the empty customers table, breaking all customer-property-ticket relationships.
2. COMPLETE DATA INTEGRITY FAILURE ‚ö†Ô∏è

602 property assignments point to non-existent customers (all orphaned)
3 tickets reference non-existent customer ID 1
0 customers exist in the table used by property assignments
All customer-property-ticket linking is broken


DATABASE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS
Ticket Analysis
sql-- 3 tickets exist, all assigned to customer_id = 1 (non-existent in customers table)
SELECT ticket_id, subject, customer_id, pay_prop_property_id, pay_prop_ticket_id 
FROM trigger_ticket;
Results:

Ticket 48: "Test Test" ‚Üí customer_id = 1
Ticket 49: "Please help me with installation" ‚Üí customer_id = 1
Ticket 50: "Boden House new Carets" ‚Üí customer_id = 1
ALL PayProp fields are NULL (no PayProp sync happening)

Property Assignment Analysis
sql-- Property 2 has 2 customer assignments pointing to non-existent customers
SELECT cpa.customer_id, cpa.assignment_type, c.name 
FROM customer_property_assignments cpa
LEFT JOIN customers c ON cpa.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE cpa.property_id = 2;
Results:

Customer 843 (TENANT) ‚Üí NULL (doesn't exist in customers table)
Customer 79 (OWNER) ‚Üí NULL (doesn't exist in customers table)

Customer Data Discovery
sql-- Found actual customer data in the 'customer' table (singular)
SELECT customer_id, name, email, is_tenant, is_property_owner 
FROM customer 
WHERE customer_id IN (1, 79, 843);
Results:

Customer 1: Abigail Webb (Property Owner) ‚úÖ Has the tickets
Customer 79: Sean Robson (Property Owner) ‚úÖ Assigned to property 2
Customer 843: Denise Regan (Tenant) ‚úÖ Assigned to property 2


ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
Why the Loading Screen Occurs

Fixed controller tries to find customers 79 & 843 in customers table
These customers don't exist in customers table (only in customer table)
Controller finds no tickets and loops indefinitely
Loading screen never resolves

System Architecture Problems

Entity Mapping Issue: Customer.java entity maps to wrong table
Missing Customer Creation Process: New customers created in customer but not customers
PayProp Integration Issue: Customer sync likely saves to wrong table
Data Migration Failure: Existing data never migrated between tables


DISCOVERED SYSTEM RELATIONSHIPS
User-Customer Hierarchy
users (5 records) 
  ‚Üì
customer (981 records) [user_id field links to users]
  ‚Üì (BROKEN LINK)
customers (0 records) [used by property assignments]
  ‚Üì
customer_property_assignments (602 records)
  ‚Üì
properties (296 records)
Ticket-Customer Relationship
trigger_ticket (3 records) ‚Üí customer_id = 1
  ‚Üì (BROKEN - customer 1 doesn't exist in customers table)
customers (0 records)

IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATE FIX
SQL Fix Applied
sql-- Created missing customer records in customers table
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email, is_tenant, is_property_owner, user_id, created_at)
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    name, 
    email, 
    is_tenant, 
    is_property_owner, 
    COALESCE(user_id, 52), -- Admin user as default (user_id was NULL)
    created_at
FROM customer 
WHERE customer_id IN (1, 79, 843);
Fix Results

‚úÖ 3 customer records created in customers table
‚úÖ Property assignments now find valid customers
‚úÖ Loading screen resolved ‚Üí shows "No tickets found"
‚úÖ Controller logic works correctly


PAYPROP INTEGRATION STATUS
Current PayProp Sync State

Properties: 295/296 synced to PayProp ‚úÖ
Customers: No sync happening (wrong table issue) ‚ùå
Tickets: No PayProp ticket sync implemented ‚ùå
Maintenance Integration: Missing entirely ‚ùå

Missing PayProp Features

Ticket Sync: No integration with PayProp maintenance endpoints
Customer Sync: Saves to wrong table, breaks property relationships
Bidirectional Communication: Cannot sync tickets TO PayProp
Invoice Generation: Missing ticket‚Üípayment‚Üíinvoice workflow


REPOSITORY/CODE ISSUES FIXED
Missing Repository Method
Fixed: Added Ticket findByPayPropTicketId(String payPropTicketId); to TicketRepository.java
Controller Compilation Issues
Fixed: All required entity getters exist:

Property.getPaypropId() ‚úÖ
Property.getPaypropPropertyId() ‚úÖ
Ticket.getPayPropPropertyId() ‚úÖ
PropertyService.findById() ‚úÖ


CRITICAL ROOT CAUSE ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION
1. Entity Mapping Fix (URGENT)
java@Entity
@Table(name = "customer") // Currently maps to "customers" (empty table)
public class Customer {
    // Should map to "customer" table (981 records)
}
2. Customer Creation Process (URGENT)

All new customer creation must use correct table
PayProp customer sync must be fixed
Customer import/registration process needs validation

3. Complete Data Migration (RECOMMENDED)
sql-- Migrate ALL 981 customers from customer ‚Üí customers
INSERT INTO customers (/* all fields */)
SELECT /* all fields */ FROM customer;
4. PayProp Integration Fixes (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

Implement PayProp maintenance ticket sync
Fix customer sync to use correct table
Add bidirectional ticket communication
Implement invoice generation workflow


TESTING VERIFICATION STEPS
Immediate Testing

‚úÖ COMPLETED: Test maintenance history page (loading screen fixed)
Next: Test customer creation (verify correct table used)
Next: Test PayProp customer sync (ensure uses correct table)

# Navigation Update for Property Owner Block Functionality

## Issue Identified
The property owner side does not display a sidebar menu even though templates include the sidebar reference. This is because `left-sidebar.html` has authorization checks that only display for `ROLE_MANAGER` or `ROLE_EMPLOYEE`, not for `ROLE_CUSTOMER`.

## Solution Implemented
Updated all block templates to use **dashboard-based navigation** matching the existing property owner navigation pattern.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Sidebar References
All block templates updated to remove the non-displaying sidebar:

**Before:**
```html
<div id="main-wrapper">
    <div th:replace="~{general/header.html}"></div>
    <div th:replace="~{general/left-sidebar.html}"></div>
    <div class="page-wrapper">
```

**After:**
```html
<div id="main-wrapper">
    <div th:replace="~{general/header.html}"></div>
    <div class="page-wrapper" style="margin-left: 0;">
```

**Files Updated:**
- `customer-login/blocks/all-blocks.html`
- `customer-login/blocks/block-details.html`
- `customer-login/blocks/edit-block.html`
- `customer-login/blocks/assignment-centre.html`

### 2. Added Block Management to Dashboard Quick Actions

Updated `property-owner/dashboard.html` to include Block Management in the Quick Actions list:

```html
<a href="/customer-login/blocks" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">
    <i class="fas fa-building text-primary"></i> Block Management
</a>
```

**Location:** Between "Portfolio Management" and "Maintenance Management" in the Quick Actions card.

### 3. Enhanced Navigation Buttons

All block pages now have navigation buttons in the Owner Mode Banner:

**All Blocks Page:**
- "Back to Dashboard" button → `/property-owner/dashboard`

**Block Details Page:**
- "Back to Blocks" button → `/customer-login/blocks`
- "Dashboard" button → `/property-owner/dashboard`

**Edit Block Page:**
- "Back to Block" button → `/customer-login/blocks/{id}`
- "Dashboard" button → `/property-owner/dashboard`

**Assignment Centre:**
- "Back to Blocks" button → `/customer-login/blocks`
- "Dashboard" button → `/property-owner/dashboard`

## Navigation Flow

```
Property Owner Dashboard
├─> Quick Actions
    ├─> Block Management (/customer-login/blocks)
        ├─> View Block Details (/customer-login/blocks/{id})
        │   ├─> Edit Block (owners only)
        │   └─> View Properties
        ├─> Assignment Centre (/customer-login/blocks/assignment-centre)
        └─> Back to Dashboard
```

## User Experience

### Property Owners
1. Log in to property owner dashboard
2. See "Block Management" in Quick Actions list
3. Click to view all blocks
4. Navigate between blocks and back to dashboard using buttons
5. Can create, edit, and delete blocks

### Delegated Users
1. Log in to property owner dashboard
2. See "Block Management" in Quick Actions list
3. Click to view accessible blocks (filtered by property access)
4. Navigate between blocks and back to dashboard
5. Read-only access (cannot create, edit, or delete)

## Consistency with Existing Pattern

The block navigation now matches the existing property owner navigation pattern:
- ✅ No sidebar dependency
- ✅ Dashboard-centric navigation
- ✅ Quick Actions as primary menu
- ✅ Breadcrumb-style back buttons
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy

## Testing

To test the navigation:

1. **Login as Property Owner**
   - Navigate to `/property-owner/dashboard`
   - Verify "Block Management" appears in Quick Actions
   - Click "Block Management" → should navigate to `/customer-login/blocks`
   - Verify back buttons work correctly

2. **Login as Delegated User**
   - Navigate to `/property-owner/dashboard`
   - Verify "Block Management" appears in Quick Actions
   - Click "Block Management" → should see filtered blocks
   - Verify no create/edit/delete options visible

3. **Navigation Flow**
   - From Dashboard → Blocks → Block Details → Dashboard (should work seamlessly)
   - From Dashboard → Blocks → Assignment Centre → Dashboard (should work seamlessly)
   - From Dashboard → Blocks → Edit → Block Details → Dashboard (owners only)

## Files Modified

1. `property-owner/dashboard.html` - Added Block Management to Quick Actions
2. `customer-login/blocks/all-blocks.html` - Removed sidebar, updated back button
3. `customer-login/blocks/block-details.html` - Removed sidebar, added navigation buttons
4. `customer-login/blocks/edit-block.html` - Removed sidebar, added navigation buttons
5. `customer-login/blocks/assignment-centre.html` - Removed sidebar, added navigation buttons

## No Sidebar Alternative

If a customer-facing sidebar is desired in the future, create a separate template:

**Option 1: Add Customer Section to Existing Sidebar**
Add a new section in `left-sidebar.html` for `ROLE_CUSTOMER`:

```html
<ul id="sidebarnav" th:if="${#authorization.expression('hasRole(''ROLE_CUSTOMER'')')}">
    <!-- Customer-specific menu items -->
</ul>
```

**Option 2: Create Separate Customer Sidebar**
Create `customer-left-sidebar.html` with customer-specific navigation and include it in customer templates.

**Current Solution: Dashboard Navigation**
The dashboard-based navigation is simpler, more intuitive for property owners, and matches the existing UX pattern, so it's the recommended approach.

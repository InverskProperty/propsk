# Transaction Isolation Fix - Successfully Deployed
**Date:** October 31, 2025, 01:37 UTC
**Status:** ‚úÖ LIVE on Render
**Commit:** e0d7506

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
PayProp syncs were failing completely because maintenance API 403 errors were causing the **entire transaction to roll back**. This prevented:
- Financial data from being saved
- PayPropDataSyncedEvent from being published
- Automatic unified_transactions rebuild from triggering

### The Solution
Added `@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)` to:
1. `syncMaintenanceCategories()`
2. `importMaintenanceTickets()`

These methods now run in **separate transactions**. When they encounter 403 errors:
- ‚úÖ They return `SyncResult.partial()` with a warning
- ‚úÖ **Parent transaction continues successfully**
- ‚úÖ Financial data gets saved
- ‚úÖ Event fires ‚Üí Automatic rebuild happens

## What Happens Next

### Automatic Process (When PayProp Sync Runs)

1. **PayProp Sync Executes**
   - Properties, owners, tenants sync ‚úÖ
   - Financial transactions sync ‚úÖ
   - Maintenance categories ‚Üí 403 error (skipped with warning) ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Maintenance tickets ‚Üí 403 error (skipped with warning) ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - **Sync completes successfully!** ‚úÖ

2. **Event System Triggers**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Comprehensive financial sync completed successfully
   üì¢ Published PayPropDataSyncedEvent
   üì• PayProp data sync detected
   üîÑ Triggering automatic unified_transactions incremental rebuild
   ‚úÖ Automatic unified rebuild completed
   ```

3. **unified_transactions Updated**
   - ICDN_ACTUAL records removed (163 records)
   - INCOMING_PAYMENT records added (106 records)
   - Table now reflects correct state

---

## Next Steps for You

### Option 1: Wait for Scheduled Sync
If you have scheduled PayProp syncs, the next one will automatically update unified_transactions.

### Option 2: Trigger Manual Sync (Recommended)
To immediately test and update unified_transactions:

**Via Admin UI:**
1. Go to your admin panel
2. Navigate to PayProp sync section
3. Click "Run Full Sync"

**Expected Logs:**
```
üöÄ SYNC STARTED: ENHANCED_UNIFIED_SYNC_WITH_FINANCIALS
‚úÖ Properties synced
‚úÖ Owners synced
‚úÖ Tenants synced
‚úÖ Financial sync completed
‚ö†Ô∏è Maintenance categories skipped - insufficient API permissions
‚ö†Ô∏è Maintenance tickets skipped - insufficient API permissions
‚úÖ Comprehensive financial sync completed successfully
üì¢ Published PayPropDataSyncedEvent for automatic unified rebuild
üì• PayProp data sync detected: COMPREHENSIVE_FINANCIAL_SYNC
üîÑ Triggering automatic unified_transactions incremental rebuild
‚úÖ Automatic unified rebuild completed: X records processed
```

### Option 3: Manual Rebuild (If sync doesn't work)
If for some reason the sync still fails, you can manually rebuild:

```bash
curl -X POST https://spoutproperty-hub.onrender.com/api/unified-transactions/rebuild/full
```

---

## How to Verify It Worked

### 1. Check Deployment Logs
Look for the new deployment logs after the next PayProp sync runs.

### 2. Query the Database
Run this to verify unified_transactions state:

```sql
-- Should show 0 ICDN records
SELECT COUNT(*) as icdn_count
FROM unified_transactions
WHERE payprop_data_source = 'ICDN_ACTUAL';

-- Should show 106 INCOMING_PAYMENT records
SELECT COUNT(*) as incoming_count
FROM unified_transactions
WHERE payprop_data_source = 'INCOMING_PAYMENT';

-- Full breakdown
SELECT
    source_system,
    payprop_data_source,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(amount) as total
FROM unified_transactions
GROUP BY source_system, payprop_data_source
ORDER BY source_system, payprop_data_source;
```

**Expected Results:**
```
SOURCE      DATA_SOURCE         COUNT    TOTAL
--------------------------------------------------
HISTORICAL  N/A                  138     ¬£106,288
PAYPROP     BATCH_PAYMENT        152     ¬£63,594
PAYPROP     COMMISSION_PAYMENT   118     ¬£12,432
PAYPROP     INCOMING_PAYMENT     106     ¬£88,560  ‚úÖ (was 0)
--------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                            514     ¬£270,874

ICDN records: 0 ‚úÖ (was 163)
```

### 3. Check Application Logs
After running a PayProp sync, check Render logs for:
- ‚úÖ "Comprehensive financial sync completed successfully"
- ‚úÖ "Published PayPropDataSyncedEvent"
- ‚úÖ "Automatic unified rebuild completed"

## What This Fixes

### Before the Fix
```
PayProp Sync Attempt
  ‚Üì
Maintenance 403 Error
  ‚Üì
‚ùå Entire transaction rolls back
  ‚Üì
‚ùå No financial data saved
  ‚Üì
‚ùå No event published
  ‚Üì
‚ùå unified_transactions stays stale
```

### After the Fix
```
PayProp Sync Attempt
  ‚Üì
Maintenance 403 Error (in separate transaction)
  ‚Üì
‚ö†Ô∏è Maintenance skipped with warning
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Financial data saved successfully
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Event published
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Automatic rebuild triggered
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ unified_transactions updated
```

## Technical Details

### Changes Made

**File:** `PayPropMaintenanceSyncService.java`

**Line 81:** Added transaction annotation to `syncMaintenanceCategories()`
```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
public SyncResult syncMaintenanceCategories() {
    // Method runs in its own transaction
    // Failure doesn't affect parent transaction
}
```

**Line 180:** Added transaction annotation to `importMaintenanceTickets()`
```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
public SyncResult importMaintenanceTickets() {
    // Method runs in its own transaction
    // Failure doesn't affect parent transaction
}
```

### Why This Works

**Spring Transaction Propagation:**
- `REQUIRED` (default): Uses existing transaction or creates new one
- `REQUIRES_NEW`: **Always creates new transaction**, suspends parent

When maintenance methods fail:
1. Their transaction rolls back
2. Parent transaction is NOT marked rollback-only
3. Parent transaction continues and commits successfully
4. Financial data saves, events fire, system works!

- `UNIFIED_TRANSACTIONS_STATUS_20251031.md` - Pre-fix status check
- `AUTOMATIC_UNIFIED_REBUILD_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Event system docs

**Code Files:**
- `PayPropMaintenanceSyncService.java` - Fixed file (2 annotations added)
- `UnifiedTransactionRebuildService.java` - Has ICDN exclusion logic
- Event system files - Ready and waiting for successful sync

---

## Monitoring

After the next PayProp sync runs, monitor:

1. **Render Logs** (https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d1e4b4re5dus739mo6o0/logs)
   - Look for "PayPropDataSyncedEvent" and "Automatic unified rebuild"

2. **Database State**
   - Query unified_transactions to verify ICDN removed, INCOMING_PAYMENT added

3. **Statements**
   - Generate a test statement to verify correct data appears

---

## If You Still Have Issues

If the sync still fails after this fix:

1. **Check for different error** - The 403 maintenance error should now be just a warning
2. **Check logs** - Look for other errors preventing sync
3. **Manual rebuild** - Use the API endpoint to manually rebuild unified_transactions
4. **Contact support** - Share the new error logs

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **PayProp sync completes** (even with maintenance warnings)
‚úÖ **Financial data saved** to financial_transactions
‚úÖ **Event published** (check logs)
‚úÖ **Automatic rebuild runs** (check logs)
‚úÖ **unified_transactions updated:**
   - ICDN_ACTUAL: 0 records
   - INCOMING_PAYMENT: 106 records
   - Total: 514 records (not 571)

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED AND READY
**Next Action:** Run a PayProp sync to test and trigger automatic unified_transactions rebuild
**Expected Result:** Sync succeeds, unified_transactions automatically updates with correct data

## üè† Property-Specific Testing

### Using Real Property Data
Your test suite includes real properties from your database:

#### Sample Properties for Testing:
```
PYZ2VG9VZQ - 10 Ditton Court Road, Westcliff (¬£1,200/month)
K3Jwqg8W1E - 71b Shrubbery Road, Croydon (¬£995/month) 
WzJBxGM1QB - 88a Satchwell Road, Canterbury (¬£960/month)

z2JkP6BpXb - 79 Alie Street, Barking (¬£1,875/month)
```

#### How to Test Individual Properties:
1. Go to **Test Data** tab
2. Click **Test** button next to any property
3. Tests multiple endpoints for that specific property:
   - ICDN transactions
   - All payments report  
   - Property details
   - Tenant information

#### How to Test Property Groups:
```
Owner Portfolio A: PYZ2VG9VZQ,K3Jwqg8W1E,WzJBxGM1QB

4. **Review results** for each endpoint tested

### Phase 2: Test with Real Property Data  
1. **Go to Test Data tab**
2. **Click "Test" on individual properties**
3. **Test property groups** for bulk operations
4. **Compare results** across different property types

### Phase 3: Investigate Critical Gaps
1. **Go to Invoice Investigation tab**  
2. **Run "Test Invoice Instructions"**
3. **Run "Compare Data Sources"** 
4. **Run "Gap Analysis"**

### Phase 4: Custom Endpoint Testing
1. **Go to Raw API tab**
2. **Test specific endpoints** you want to investigate
3. **Try different parameters** and date ranges

## üéØ Expected Test Results & What They Mean

### ‚úÖ SUCCESS Results
- **Endpoint is accessible** and returns data
- **Your system could utilize** this capability  
- **Consider implementing** if business value exists

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING Results  
- **Endpoint exists but no data** returned
- **May require different parameters** or permissions
- **Worth investigating further** 

### ‚ùå ERROR Results
- **Endpoint not available** in your PayProp setup
- **May be restricted** by your subscription level
- **Or may not exist** (test discovers this)

## üìä SQL Queries for Additional Test Data

Run these queries in your database to get more test data:

### Properties with Commission Rates:
```sql
SELECT p.pay_prop_id, p.property_name, p.monthly_payment, 
       p.commission_percentage, c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM properties p 
JOIN customers c ON p.property_owner_id = c.customer_id
WHERE p.pay_prop_id IS NOT NULL 
AND p.commission_percentage > 0
ORDER BY p.monthly_payment DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Multi-Property Owners:
```sql  
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, 
       COUNT(p.id) as property_count,
       GROUP_CONCAT(p.pay_prop_id) as payprop_ids
FROM customers c 
JOIN properties p ON c.customer_id = p.property_owner_id
WHERE p.pay_prop_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.customer_id 
HAVING property_count >= 2
ORDER BY property_count DESC;
```

### Properties with Recent Financial Activity:
```sql
SELECT p.pay_prop_id, p.property_name, 
       COUNT(ft.id) as transaction_count,
       SUM(ft.amount) as total_amount
FROM properties p 
LEFT JOIN financial_transactions ft ON p.pay_prop_id = ft.property_id
WHERE p.pay_prop_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY p.pay_prop_id
HAVING transaction_count > 0
ORDER BY transaction_count DESC;
```

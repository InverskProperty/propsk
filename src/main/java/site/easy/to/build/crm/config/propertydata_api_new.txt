Getting started
Authentication
Every request to the PropertyData API requires a key.

You can sign up for a 14-day free trial to experiment with the API.

HTTP method
Every request to the PropertyData API should be a GET request.

API credits
Most endpoints cost 1 API credit per request. However, certain endpoints may incur extra

API credits per request depending on the type or volume of data retrieved. This information

is displayed clearly in the 'API credit cost' section on the documentation pages for each

endpoint.

CORS
We support CORS, which allows Javascript requests to be made across domains. Each

response contains the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * header that enables CORS.

Nonetheless, exposing your API key in publicly visible source code is not recommended.

You remain responsible for any and all requests made to the API using your key.

Data collection logic
Most API endpoints require you to supply a UK postcode - full (e.g. 'W14 9JH'), district (e.g.

'W14') or sector (e.g. 'W14 9').

If you supply a full postcode, data will be collected by enlarging a circle around that

postcode until the required number of points (typically 20 by default, although you can

customise this) has been found. A 'radius' value in miles will be returned to indicate how

large the circle was expanded. Using this method, you should receive data in 99%+ of cases.

If you supply a postcode sector or district, all data in that sector or district will be used.

Using this method, you are more likely to receive an insufficient data message.

Data coverage
Due to source data limitations, some endpoints do not work across all constituent countries

of the United Kingdom. Coverage for API endpoints is as follows:

Individual property ratings are not available in Scotland
Response times
Heavy data processing is carried out at run-time for many API endpoints. Therefore,

response times may be higher than you are used to with other APIs. We consider a 1,000ms

response time to be average for most endpoints. As a result, we advise you not to send

requests to our API as a critical-path component of your application at run-time - we

suggest an asynchronous request instead.

We are constantly working to improve performance of the API. The processing time is

returned with every API request; if you are receiving numbers that you consider to be

excessively high, please get in touch with debugging information so we can investigate.

/address-to-uprn

Tips to improve your search results:

â— Results can be greatly improved by including commas to separate your search terms e.g.
'Ordnance Survey, 4, Adanac Drive, Nursling, Southampton, SO16 0AS'
â— Make sure the address elements in your search are in the correct order.
â— Make sure you provide enough information when searching for an address. Remember that
postcodes can cover up to 99 properties, therefore including a street name and building
name/number will narrow down the search results.
â— Don't over complicate your search with unnecessary elements e.g. 'Room 301, Level 3,
Organisation Name, Building Name, Street, Postcode' includes information that is not held in
the database (Room 301, Level 3) and could be removed from the search to help improve the
results.

/site-plan-documents
API credit cost

EnglandWalesScotlandN. Ireland

Purchase an A4 scale site plan for a given Land Registry Title Number, suitable for use with

planning applications.

A range of scales between 1:100 and 1:2500 area available.

A successful request to this endpoint will return a document_url which can be used to

download the Site Plan PDF document for the next 6 months.

The site plan will be centered on the largest plot associated with the provided title.

For some Titles which cover a lot of land, the larger map scales will not be available. If this

is the case you will receive a 400 error on the API with error code 3701. Try the call again

using a smaller scale such that the map covers a larger area, for example 1:500 instead of

1:200.

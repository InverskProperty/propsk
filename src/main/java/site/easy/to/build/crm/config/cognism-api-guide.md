# Cognism API Guide

## Overview

The Cognism API is used to search, preview and enrich Contacts and Accounts. Cognism database provides extensive B2B contacts and sales intelligence data.

**Note:** API responses may differ from the results retrieved via Prospector search (Web Application). Cognism strives to ensure that the API is updated regularly to align as closely as possible with Prospector search results.

## Key Benefits

- Better accuracy on technology and event searches
- Ability to create more complex queries
- Unlimited results (removes limitation of 10,000 displayed results)
- Visibility for all open positions for each contact - with different emails and company phones
- Ability to configure the response fields in line with the entitlements

## Authentication

Cognism uses API keys to allow access to the APIs. The API Key is assigned to you by Cognism and it is used to authenticate and authorize each request.

- Your API key should be kept private, and should never be displayed publicly
- API keys have a time-to-live (TTL) of 6 months
- You can manually generate additional keys or remove existing ones using Cognism Prospector or Cognism Refresh

You can authenticate HTTP requests in one of two ways:

1. Using header field `"Authorization: Bearer <API KEY>"` (recommended)
2. Using query string `"api_key={API KEY}"`

## API Structure

API contains a set of HTTPS endpoints providing all necessary details to preview and redeem contacts of your choice. The API is built using RESTful endpoints and standard HTTP verbs.

## Entitlements

Entitlements are a defined set of Contact and Account data that is available for you. They are set by Cognism Support Team. Entitlement definition affects Search, Preview and Result. Entitlements are related to the API Key.

**Important:** Cognism API cannot be used unless Entitlements are properly set up.

## Basic Info

No matter what entitlement you choose, basic info will always be present. This is minimum data defining Contact or Account entity. Entitlements are built on top of basic info.

### Basic Contact Info

```json
{
  "id": "String (UUID)",
  "fullName": "String",
  "firstName": "String",
  "lastName": "String",
  "jobTitle": "String",
  "account": {
    "id": "String",
    "name": "String"
  }
}
```

### Basic Account Info

```json
{
  "id": "String",
  "name": "String"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

All API requests are subject to rate limits that exist independently of your API key's monthly usage allowance. The maximum rate limit is 1,000 requests per minute.

Number of previews available = Number of credits available, multiplied by 10.

### HTTP Headers and Response Codes

Use the HTTP headers to understand where the application is at for a given rate limit:

- `x-rate-total-limit`: The rate limit ceiling for all endpoints for the 1 minute window
- `x-rate-total-limit-remaining`: The number of requests left remaining for the 1 minute window
- `x-rate-limit-reset`: Number of seconds before rate limits are reset
- `x-rate-limit-user`: User name
- `x-rate-endpoint-limit`: The rate limit ceiling for single endpoints for the 1 minute window
- `x-rate-endpoint-limit-remaining`: The number of requests left remaining for single endpoints for the 1 minute window
- `x-rate-result-limit`: Total number of preview profiles within API contract (credits Ã— 10)
- `x-rate-result-limit-remaining`: Total number of remaining requests within API contract
- `x-rate-result-limit-reset`: Number of seconds before rate result limit is reset (until end of current contract)

**HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests"**: This response code is returned when an application exceeds the rate limit for a given API endpoint, with the error: `{ "errors": [ { "code": 88, "message": "Rate limit exceeded" } ] }`

## Main API Endpoints

Perfect, thanks for confirming! Since it's for internal research and testing, I’ll focus on cost-effective, accurate, self-hosted scraping solutions suitable for extracting contact data from UK websites. I’ll factor in proxy and scraper options that support LinkedIn, Facebook, and others, while keeping deployment-friendly options like cloud services in mind.

I’ll get back to you soon with the best recommendations.

# Cost-Effective Self-Hosted Scraping Solutions for UK Contact Data

## Introduction  
Collecting contact details (emails, phone numbers, social profiles) from UK-specific websites can be challenging due to anti-scraping measures and legal considerations. This report evaluates **self-hosted web scraping setups** for sources like **192.com** (UK people/business directory), **118** services (phone directories), **Cylex UK** (business listings), and social platforms (**LinkedIn**, **Facebook**, **Instagram**, etc.). The goal is to identify the **most cost-effective solution** for scraping ~**40,000 records per month** for internal research/testing. We prioritize **cost** first, then **accuracy**, and lastly **speed**. Key components – scraping frameworks, headless browsers, CAPTCHA solving, proxy networks, and anti-bot techniques – are discussed with estimated costs. We also address compliance (UK data laws and platform terms) and deployment considerations.

## Requirements & Challenges  
- **Volume & Scale:** ~40k records monthly (~1.3k/day). The solution should handle this volume consistently.  
- **Self-Hosted:** All scraping runs on user-controlled infrastructure (e.g. cloud VM or on-premise). Third-party data APIs (e.g. Apollo, ZoomInfo) are excluded, though proxy or CAPTCHA services are acceptable.  
- **Cost Focus:** Minimize monthly costs – including infrastructure, proxies, and any software – while maintaining reasonable data accuracy.  
- **Accuracy Needs:** Extract key contact info (emails, phones, social links) reliably. Some sites might require rendering JavaScript or login for full data.  
- **Speed Constraints:** Speed is lower priority; running scrapers slowly or in parallel is acceptable if it reduces cost or bans.  
- **Targets & Anti-Scraping:** UK-specific sites often have anti-bot defenses. For example, LinkedIn and Facebook aggressively detect scrapers, sometimes blocking even high-quality proxies ([Top 8 LinkedIn Proxies in 2025: Analyzed Features & Pricing](https://research.aimultiple.com/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=We%20tried%20various%20proxies%20to,that%20we%20used)). Directories like 192.com may throttle queries or require logins for detailed info. We must employ techniques to avoid IP bans, CAPTCHAs, or account locks.  
- **Compliance:** Scraping personal data must heed UK laws (Data Protection Act/GDPR). Public data scraping is generally legal, but scraping **personal data** or content behind logins can raise legal and ethical issues ([Is web scraping legal? Yes, if you know the rules.](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/#:~:text=Web%20scraping%20is%20legal%20if,for%20compliant%20and%20ethical%20scrapers)) ([Is web scraping legal? Yes, if you know the rules.](https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/#:~:text=Web%20scraping%20is%20legal%20if,intellectual%20property%2C%20or%20confidential%20data)). LinkedIn’s and Facebook’s terms of service forbid unauthorized scraping, so stealth and caution are needed to avoid detection or legal repercussions.  
- **UK Context:** Prefer UK-based IP addresses to access local content (some UK sites or search results may require a UK IP). Avoid free proxies – they are often slow, insecure, or blocked ([5 Best UK Proxy Providers of 2025 - Proxyway](https://proxyway.com/proxy-locations/uk-proxy#:~:text=Why%20You%20Should%20NOT%20Use,a%20Free%20UK%20IP%20Address)). Ensure any data handling aligns with UK privacy expectations.

## Key Technical Components  

### Web Scraping Frameworks vs. Headless Browsers  
Choosing the right scraping tool greatly impacts cost and efficiency:  

- **Scrapy (Python):** A lightweight, asynchronous scraping framework ideal for large-scale crawling of static pages. It can dispatch many requests concurrently and parse HTML efficiently. Scrapy alone cannot execute JavaScript, but it can integrate with tools (e.g. Splash or Playwright) when needed ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer: Which One to Choose? - ZenRows](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=environment%20and%20requires%20more%20setup,scale%20scraping)) ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer for Web Scraping](https://brightdata.com/blog/web-data/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=,For)). It’s memory-efficient and fast for HTML content, making it suitable for high-volume **text-based** scraping ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer: Which One to Choose? - ZenRows](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=Browser%20None%20Headless%20Chrome%20Avoid,Consumes%20more%20memory%20than%20Scrapy)). Scrapy supports middleware for proxy rotation and user-agent spoofing out-of-the-box ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer for Web Scraping](https://brightdata.com/blog/web-data/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=,of%20the%20Scrapy%20middleware%20class)) ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer for Web Scraping](https://brightdata.com/blog/web-data/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=Scrapy%20also%20boasts%20a%20rich,Agent)). For example, one can plug in a headless browser (via Playwright or Selenium) only on pages requiring it, while handling simpler pages with Scrapy’s HTTP fetching to save resources ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer for Web Scraping](https://brightdata.com/blog/web-data/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=,page%20loads%20fast%20enough%20or)). **Pros:** Free (open-source), excellent for parallel requests and large volumes, low memory usage. **Cons:** Requires extra setup to handle JS-heavy sites (e.g. configuring Splash, or using Scrapy’s Playwright integration).  

- **Headless Browsers (Puppeteer/Playwright/Selenium):** These automate a real browser (Chrome/Firefox) to render pages and simulate user actions. They are essential for scraping sites that require JS execution or heavy client-side rendering (e.g. LinkedIn’s dynamically loaded content, infinite scroll on Instagram feeds). Tools like **Puppeteer** (Node.js) or **Playwright** (Node/Python) control headless Chrome/Chromium. They can stealthily automate logins, clicks, and scrolls, retrieving content exactly as a user sees. **Pros:** Can handle any dynamic site, interact with UI elements, and bypass some anti-bot measures by behaving like a real browser (especially if using stealth plugins to mask automation ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer: Which One to Choose? - ZenRows](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=JavaScript%20support%20Requires%20integrations%20with,Consumes%20more%20memory%20than%20Scrapy)) ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer for Web Scraping](https://brightdata.com/blog/web-data/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=Puppeteer%20also%20supports%20rotating%20proxies%2C,as%C2%A0stealth%2C%20which%20makes%20things%20easier))). **Cons:** **Slow and resource-intensive** – launching Chrome for each page is heavy. In tests, Scrapy (with Splash) could fetch a JS page in ~4.4s whereas Selenium took ~13s ([Scrapy vs. Selenium in 2025: In-depth Comparison - ZenRows](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/scrapy-vs-selenium#:~:text=match%20at%20L295%20We%20ran,to%20obtain%20the%20same%20content)). Running multiple headless browsers in parallel strains CPU/RAM and slows down scraping ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer for Web Scraping](https://brightdata.com/blog/web-data/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=running%20multiple%20headless%20browsers%20isn%E2%80%99t,Puppeteer%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20excel%20at%20speed)) ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer: Which One to Choose? - ZenRows](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=Puppeteer%20launches%20a%20browser%20instance,Puppeteer%20instances%20running%20in%20parallel)). Thus, headless solutions increase infrastructure cost for hardware and time. They also demand careful tweaks to avoid detection (e.g. using Playwright’s **stealth** mode to modify headless browser fingerprints ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer for Web Scraping](https://brightdata.com/blog/web-data/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=the%20main%20reasons%20for%20choosing,more%20on%20this%20later))).  

**Recommendation:** Use Scrapy (or similar asynchronous scrapers) as the primary tool for cost-efficiency, and employ headless browsers **selectively** for sources that truly need it. This hybrid approach captures the best of both – Scrapy for speed and low cost on simpler sites, and headless automation for accuracy on complex sites ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer for Web Scraping](https://brightdata.com/blog/web-data/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=Scrapy%20and%20Puppeteer%20are%20tools,content%20after%20specific%20user%20interactivity)). 

### Proxy Solutions (IP Rotation)  
**Proxies** are essential for web scraping at scale, especially for **40k requests/month**, to prevent IP blocking. They route your requests through alternate IP addresses. Key options:  

- **Datacenter Proxies:** IPs provided by cloud data centers. They are **cheap and fast**, but easier for websites to identify as bots (many scrapers use them, and their IP ranges are well-known) ([Datacenter vs Residential Proxies: Comparison Guide for 2025](https://www.proxy-cheap.com/blog/datacenter-vs-residential-proxies#:~:text=Datacenter%20vs%20Residential%20Proxies%3A%20Comparison,conscious%20users.%20Scalability%3A)). However, some UK directories might not have aggressive detection against datacenter IPs. Cost is a big advantage: providers offer large request volumes for relatively low fees. *Example:* A provider offers **200,000 requests/month** via a rotating datacenter proxy pool for about **$59/month** ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=Beginner)). Bandwidth is usually unlimited in such plans ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=,Fast%20Customer%20Support)). For our ~40k records (potentially ~100–150k HTTP requests including page navigations), a ~$60 plan is likely sufficient. **Pros:** Lowest cost per request, high speed. **Cons:** Lower success on hardened sites (likely to get CAPTCHA or bans on LinkedIn/Facebook).  

- **Residential Proxies:** IPs that originate from real consumer ISPs (real home users). These appear as ordinary user traffic and are much harder for targets to detect or ban ([5 Best UK Proxy Providers of 2025 - Proxyway](https://proxyway.com/proxy-locations/uk-proxy#:~:text=proxy%20is%20a%20simple%20process,of%20the%20providers%20we%20recommend)). They significantly improve success on strict platforms. **However, they cost more** due to the complexity of maintaining a peer network. Often pricing is usage-based (e.g. dollars per GB of data) or per request. For example, 200k requests of residential IP access might cost around **$150/month** ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=Beginner)) (roughly 2.5× the datacenter price for the same volume). Some providers charge ~$7 per GB, which for ~5–10 GB that 40k scrapes might consume, comes to ~$35–$70; others have flat plans (e.g. **$150 for 200k requests** as noted) ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=Beginner)). **Pros:** High success rate, needed for sites like LinkedIn (which often block datacenter IPs immediately) ([Top 8 LinkedIn Proxies in 2025: Analyzed Features & Pricing](https://research.aimultiple.com/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=We%20tried%20various%20proxies%20to,that%20we%20used)). **Cons:** Higher cost.  

- **Mobile Proxies:** IPs from mobile carriers (3G/4G). These are extremely effective (websites almost never ban mobile network ranges broadly), but **very expensive**. Typically used only if LinkedIn or Instagram still block residential IPs. Mobile proxy plans can cost hundreds of USD per month for a handful of IPs. For cost-focused needs, these are overkill unless absolutely required for small critical portions.  

- **Rotating vs. Static:** Many proxy services offer **rotating proxy gateways** – each request automatically goes out via a different IP from a large pool. This is great for broad web crawling. All the above types can be rotating. Some use cases may require a **sticky session** (keeping the same IP for a series of requests, e.g. to maintain a login session); good providers support sticky sessions for minutes or longer ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=,Fast%20Customer%20Support)) ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=,Fast%20Customer%20Support)). Our use case (crawling many unrelated records) benefits from rotation to distribute load and avoid quotas tied to a single IP.  

**Proxy cost estimates:** To scrape 40k records/month cost-effectively, a likely approach is **mixing proxy types** per target: use cheaper datacenter proxies for less protected sites (e.g. 192.com, Cylex), and reserve residential IPs for the toughest targets (LinkedIn, Facebook). Table 1 compares approximate proxy costs:

| **Proxy Type**       | **Provider Example**        | **Plan**                  | **Monthly Cost**        | **Notes**                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Datacenter (rotating)| PrivateProxy – Beginner-DC ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=Beginner)) | 200k requests/month       | **$59**                | Unlimited bandwidth, large IP pool, moderate success rate ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=,Fast%20Customer%20Support)). Cheapest option per request. |
| Residential (rotating)| PrivateProxy – Beginner-RES ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=Beginner)) | 200k requests/month       | **$150**               | Higher success rate on anti-bot sites ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=,Fast%20Customer%20Support)). More “human” IPs, but ~2–3× cost of DC proxies. |
| Residential (traffic-based) | Smartproxy (UK pool) ([Buy Residential Proxies - Best Residential IPs from $1.5/GB](https://smartproxy.com/proxies/residential-proxies#:~:text=Buy%20Residential%20Proxies%20,9)) ([Buy Residential Proxies - Best Residential IPs from $1.5/GB](https://smartproxy.com/proxies/residential-proxies#:~:text=Buy%20residential%20proxies%20for%20any,9)) | ~5 GB data (~40k requests) | **$25–$50** (est.)     | Pay-as-you-go by GB (e.g. $5–$7/GB, volume discounts) ([Buy Residential Proxies - Best Residential IPs from $1.5/GB](https://smartproxy.com/proxies/residential-proxies#:~:text=Buy%20Residential%20Proxies%20,9)). Cost depends on data size of pages. |
| Mobile (4G)           | Various (UK SIM proxy)     | 1–2 mobile IPs, unlimited data | **$100+**             | Typically ~$100/IP for 4G unlimited. Use only if other proxy types fail for certain sites. |

*Table 1: Proxy options and estimated monthly costs for ~40k records.*  

**Additional proxy notes:** Always choose **UK exit nodes** for UK sites if possible, to ensure local content and avoid geo-blocks. All major providers (Bright Data, Smartproxy, Oxylabs, etc.) allow UK targeting. Avoid **free proxies** – they often compromise security and performance, and may not support HTTPS reliably ([5 Best UK Proxy Providers of 2025 - Proxyway](https://proxyway.com/proxy-locations/uk-proxy#:~:text=Why%20You%20Should%20NOT%20Use,a%20Free%20UK%20IP%20Address)). Instead, low-cost services like Webshare offer configurable plans (even a limited free tier of 10 IPs) to get started, but paid plans yield better reliability ([5 Best UK Proxy Providers of 2025 - Proxyway](https://proxyway.com/proxy-locations/uk-proxy#:~:text=,Free%20plan%20with%2010%20IPs)). Also note that even with good proxies, hitting sensitive sites too fast or in large bursts can trigger blocks. Therefore, proxies should be combined with proper **rate limiting** and bot behavior mimicry (discussed next).

### CAPTCHA Solving  
Many sites present CAPTCHAs when they suspect bots. For example, Google reCAPTCHA or Cloudflare challenges might appear on LinkedIn or Facebook after multiple rapid requests. To maintain scraping flow, CAPTCHAs must be solved or bypassed:  

- **Third-Party Solving Services:** Services like **2Captcha**, **Anti-Captcha**, **DeathByCaptcha**, etc., outsource CAPTCHA solving to human workers or AI. The scraper submits the CAPTCHA (image or token) and gets back the answer. These services are relatively inexpensive. For instance, solving a normal image or text CAPTCHA costs around **$0.5–$1 per 1000** solves, and even complex CAPTCHAs (Google reCAPTCHA v2) cost roughly **$1–$3 per 1000** ([Captcha prices](https://2captcha.com/pricing#:~:text=%D0%A1aptcha%20type%20Useful%20links%20Price,speed%20Free%20capacity%2C%20per%20minute)). That’s $0.001–$0.003 each – negligible per record. Even if 5% of 40k requests trigger a CAPTCHA (2,000 CAPTCHAs), the cost would be well under $10. Integration is straightforward via APIs (they have Python bindings, etc.). **Downside:** Adds some latency (solving might take ~10–30 seconds), and reliance on an external service (though still “self-hosted” scraping since you control when to call the API).  

- **Self-Hosted Solvers:** There are software like **CapMonster** or open-source ML models that attempt to solve CAPTCHAs automatically. These usually involve one-time license costs or resource-intensive AI models. For small-scale use, they may not be cost-effective compared to cheap human-solver services. However, for speed or privacy concerns, one could deploy their own solver for certain types of CAPTCHAs (e.g. simple ones like math or image classification).  

- **CAPTCHA Avoidance:** The best strategy is to **avoid CAPTCHAs** by reducing bot detection. Using residential IPs, simulating realistic browser behavior, and throttling request rate can prevent many CAPTCHAs from ever appearing. Nevertheless, one should budget for a CAPTCHA solver in case. For social media targets, solving challenges is often part of the game (e.g. solving a puzzle or image-selection challenge for LinkedIn as reported in experiments ([Top 8 LinkedIn Proxies in 2025: Analyzed Features & Pricing](https://research.aimultiple.com/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=remain%20unchanged,restricted%20access%20to%20its%20platform))).  

**CAPTCHA cost estimate:** Allocate about **$5–$15/month** for CAPTCHA solving (via a service) for ~40k record scraping. This assumes a few thousand challenges at ~$2 per 1000 solves ([Captcha prices](https://2captcha.com/pricing#:~:text=reCAPTCHA%20V2How%20to%20solveDemo%241%20%E2%80%94,Solving%20speed)). If our scraper design is gentle, actual encounters may be much lower.  

### Anti-Bot Evasion Techniques  
Even with browsers and proxies, scraping can be foiled by advanced bot-detection (fingerprinting, behavior analysis). Some additional measures to improve accuracy (with minimal cost impact) include:

- **User-Agent and Headers Rotation:** Rotate the HTTP `User-Agent` string to mimic different browsers or devices on each request ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer for Web Scraping](https://brightdata.com/blog/web-data/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=Scrapy%20also%20boasts%20a%20rich,Agent)). Also randomize other headers (Accept-Language, Referer, etc.) to appear more like diverse real visitors. Libraries like **fake-useragent** or built-in Scrapy settings can cycle these. This is a free and effective way to avoid trivial detection.  

- **Browser Stealth Plugins:** If using Playwright or Puppeteer, enable stealth mode (e.g. Puppeteer’s official stealth plugin or Playwright stealth). This hides automation-specific DOM properties and other giveaways that headless Chrome sets ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer for Web Scraping](https://brightdata.com/blog/web-data/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=the%20main%20reasons%20for%20choosing,more%20on%20this%20later)). It can, for example, spoof navigator properties, hide that `webdriver` flag, and randomize WebGL fingerprints. These tools are open-source.  

- **Timed Delays and Human-like Patterns:** Instead of hitting a site with machine-like speed, introduce random think times between actions. For instance, when scraping profiles on LinkedIn with a headless browser, insert a 2-5 second random delay and scroll slowly, as a human would. This reduces the chance of being flagged by behavior analysis. It slows down scraping, but since speed is low priority for us, this is an acceptable trade-off for better accuracy.  

- **Session Management:** For sites requiring login (LinkedIn, Facebook), maintain session cookies and reuse them to avoid constant logins (which trigger suspicion). However, be careful: using one account for 40k queries is risky. It may be necessary to **create multiple accounts** and rotate them. (Note: This can violate terms of service – LinkedIn explicitly allows only one account per person ([Top 8 LinkedIn Proxies in 2025: Analyzed Features & Pricing](https://research.aimultiple.com/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=Manage%20multiple%20LinkedIn%20accounts)) – so any multi-account strategy should assume those accounts may eventually get restricted). If accounts are used, treat them as semi-disposable and do not scrape too aggressively per account.  

- **Headless = False:** When possible, run the browser in non-headless mode (visible mode) but in a virtual display. Some anti-bot systems detect the `headless` Chrome attribute. Running a full browser (with GUI disabled via XVFB on a server) can bypass simplistic headless checks at the expense of more resources. Newer headless modes (Chrome’s headless “stealth” in recent versions or using Chrome with proper flags) mitigate this, so this is an optional idea.  

- **Bypass APIs and Tools:** In some cases, using official or semi-official APIs can be a compliance-friendly alternative. E.g., for Instagram, the public Graph API might allow certain data access within rate limits. However, such APIs often do **not** expose personal contact info (emails/phones), so for our purpose (contact scraping) they may not be useful.  

Combining these techniques will improve success rates, especially on platforms like LinkedIn which were found to flag even residential IP traffic immediately without careful browser fingerprint management ([Top 8 LinkedIn Proxies in 2025: Analyzed Features & Pricing](https://research.aimultiple.com/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=We%20tried%20various%20proxies%20to,that%20we%20used)). 

## Proposed Scraping Solution Setups  

Based on the components above, we consider three viable self-hosted setups:

### Option 1: **Scrapy-Centric Pipeline (Cost-First Approach)**  
**Overview:** Use Scrapy (or a similar asynchronous crawler) for the majority of scraping, and augment it with headless browsing only where strictly necessary. This approach minimizes overhead by using fast HTTP fetching for simpler sites and keeps the browser automation to a minimum. 

- **Implementation:** Develop Scrapy spiders for each site. For **192.com**, **118 directory**, **Cylex UK**, etc., Scrapy can directly fetch search result pages and profile pages (parsing HTML for names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.). Scrapy’s middleware can manage proxies and handle request throttling. For pages requiring JS (perhaps some modern web features on Facebook or to click “show email” buttons), integrate a tool like **Scrapy Playwright** or trigger a Selenium/Playwright instance just for those pages. For example, the spider can detect a LinkedIn profile URL and delegate it to a headless browser middleware which logs in and scrapes it, then returns control to Scrapy for parsing. This way, 80-90% of the requests (mostly to easier sites) are handled by low-cost Scrapy HTTP calls, and only 10-20% go through expensive browser automation.  

- **Infrastructure:** A single mid-range server can run multiple Scrapy threads and a few browser instances as needed. **Deployment suggestion:** a cloud VM with ~2–4 vCPUs and 4–8GB RAM (e.g. an AWS EC2 t3.medium or t3.large, or a DigitalOcean 2vCPU Droplet). This costs roughly **$15–$40 per month** ([t3.small specs and pricing | AWS - CloudPrice](https://cloudprice.net/aws/ec2/instances/t3.small#:~:text=t3.small%20specs%20and%20pricing%20,cheaper%20alternative%20is)) ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=2%20GiB%201%20vCPU%202%2C000,00Get%20Started)). For instance, an AWS t3.small (2vCPU, 2GB) in London is about $15/month on-demand ([t3.small specs and pricing | AWS - CloudPrice](https://cloudprice.net/aws/ec2/instances/t3.small#:~:text=t3.small%20specs%20and%20pricing%20,cheaper%20alternative%20is)), and a t3.medium (2vCPU, 4GB) about $30/month. Alternatively, a DigitalOcean droplet with 2 vCPU and 2GB RAM is $18/month ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=2%20GiB%201%20vCPU%202%2C000,00Get%20Started)) (4GB RAM for $24). This should suffice given our volume – with speed not critical, the scraper can run continuously at a modest pace.  

- **Proxies:** Use **rotating datacenter proxies** by default to keep costs low. Integrate proxy use in Scrapy settings (Scrapy allows setting a proxy per request via middleware). Only switch to residential proxies for targets known to block datacenter IPs (likely LinkedIn, maybe Facebook). This could mean maintaining two proxy pools: e.g., route all `*.linkedin.com` requests through a residential proxy gateway, and everything else through a datacenter proxy. Many proxy providers allow choosing specific endpoints or have an API to select the proxy type per request. The cost breakdown might be: datacenter proxy plan ~$60/month ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=Beginner)), plus a smaller residential proxy usage for, say, 5k out of the 40k records (the ones from LinkedIn/FB), which could be ~$20-$50 (if usage is ~5GB or ~20k requests) ([Buy Residential Proxies - Best Residential IPs from $1.5/GB](https://smartproxy.com/proxies/residential-proxies#:~:text=Buy%20Residential%20Proxies%20,9)). This keeps proxy costs around **$80–$110** total.  

- **CAPTCHA Solving:** Use an API like 2Captcha on demand. Integrated in Scrapy, whenever a page responds with a CAPTCHA (Scrapy can detect the typical HTML or JS challenge), pause and send to solver. At perhaps a few dollars per month ([Captcha prices](https://2captcha.com/pricing#:~:text=%D0%A1aptcha%20type%20Useful%20links%20Price,speed%20Free%20capacity%2C%20per%20minute)) ([Captcha prices](https://2captcha.com/pricing#:~:text=Cloudflare%20TurnstileHow%20to%20solveDemo%241,Solving%20speed)), this is minor. 

- **Pros:** Very **cost-effective** – maximizes use of free/open-source tools and cheap proxies. Scrapy’s efficiency means faster scraping of easy sites (less compute time, which indirectly saves cloud hours). Using datacenter IPs for non-sensitive sites leverages their low cost. Overall, this setup could come in well under $150/month all-inclusive, potentially near the ~$100 mark, which is about $0.0025 per record (2.5 cents per 10 records). It’s also flexible: Scrapy’s modular design makes it easy to add new sources or parse new fields.  
- **Cons:** The development effort is higher. You must maintain Scrapy spiders for each site and handle edge cases (site layout changes, login flows, etc.). When a site does require heavy JS or login, integrating that with Scrapy adds complexity. Accuracy on sites like LinkedIn depends on the sophistication of the headless integration – you may need to manage cookies, solve login CAPTCHAs, and rotate accounts. There’s a risk that if LinkedIn’s anti-bot measures escalate (they are extremely stringent ([Top 8 LinkedIn Proxies in 2025: Analyzed Features & Pricing](https://research.aimultiple.com/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=We%20tried%20various%20proxies%20to,that%20we%20used))), even the small percentage of requests through Playwright might get flagged, slowing that portion down (e.g. more CAPTCHAs or temporary bans on your residential IP pool). In short, this approach requires **continuous tuning and monitoring**, trading human effort for monetary cost savings. Speed is moderate – Scrapy can crawl concurrently, but when it invokes a headless browser for some tasks, those will be slower. Given our volume, this is acceptable.

**Estimated Monthly Cost (Option 1):**  
- Cloud VM (self-managed, e.g. 2–4 vCPU in UK region): **$20–$30** (average).  
- Proxy networks: **$60** (DC proxies) + **$30** (Residential usage) = ~$90.  
- CAPTCHA solving service: **$5** (approximate).  
- **Total: ≈ $120/month** (around **$3 per 1k records**).  

This is a rough estimate; actual costs could be lower if fewer residential proxies are needed (or if the scrape load is optimized), or slightly higher if more CAPTCHAs are encountered. 

### Option 2: **Headless-Browser Pipeline (Accuracy-First Approach)**  
**Overview:** Use a headless browser for **all** scraping to maximize accuracy and mimic human behavior. In this setup, tools like Puppeteer or Playwright drive the entire data collection process, ensuring that even the most dynamic or protected sites are handled in the same way as easier ones. This sacrifices speed and some cost to reduce development complexity (one unified approach for all sites) and potentially improve success on hard targets.

- **Implementation:** Write scripts or use a framework (like **Selenium** with Python, or **Playwright** in Python) to automate each target website. For example, a LinkedIn scraper script logs into a dummy account, searches or navigates to profile URLs, and extracts contact info sections; a 192.com script enters query terms and clicks through the interface to reveal phone numbers, etc. Each of these can run in a headless browser context. You could still have separate scripts per site (due to differing flows), but all use the common approach of browser automation. Optionally, use an orchestration tool (like a simple Python scheduler or a headless browser cloud manager) to queue up tasks. Because everything runs through a browser, it will handle JavaScript, page redirects, etc., inherently. Anti-bot measures are mitigated by the fact that you appear as a real browser (though still need proxies and good practices to avoid stands out). 

- **Infrastructure:** This approach is resource-heavy. If running **Chrome/Chromium** instances for every request, memory and CPU usage will spike. You may need a more powerful machine or even a small cluster of machines if you want parallelism. However, given speed is not critical, one strategy is to **run sequentially or with low concurrency** – e.g. one browser instance that processes one page at a time continuously. It will be slow per page, but across 24/7 operation it can still handle ~40k pages in a month (~1-2 pages per minute on average). A modern cloud VM with **4 vCPUs and 8 GB RAM** could likely handle 2-3 headless Chrome instances in parallel, which might be sufficient. That size VM on AWS is ~$80/month, on DigitalOcean about $48/month (8GB, 4vCPU) ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=Memory%20vCPU%20Transfer%20SSD%24%2Fhr%24%2Fmo%20512,00%20126%20Get)) ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=2%20GiB%201%20vCPU%202%2C000,00Get%20Started)). If we throttle to mostly single-threaded operation, a 2 vCPU/4GB machine (~$30/mo) might even do, but risk hitting CPU credit limits. For safety, assume around **$50–$80/month** in server costs for this fully headless approach. Another deployment tip: consider using **containerized browsers** (Docker images like browserless/chrome) so you can easily scale containers on one host or multiple as needed.  

- **Proxies:** **Residential proxies** are strongly recommended in this setup, since the whole point is to be as human-like as possible. Using datacenter IPs while running a full Chrome may still get you blocked quickly on sites like Facebook/LinkedIn – the IP is often the first red flag. Residential rotating proxies (or ISP proxies) ensure the IP footprint looks like normal users. One could subscribe to a plan like **$150/month for ~1M requests** ([Linkedin Proxy [Buy Linkedin Private Proxies] | PrivateProxy.me](https://privateproxy.me/proxies-for-social-networks/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=Scraper)) (far more than needed) or a smaller usage-based plan. We might estimate around **$100/month** for proxy if largely residential. If budget is an issue, one might attempt datacenter proxies for the *less protected* targets (as in Option 1), but the operational simplicity of this approach is somewhat lost if you have to treat sites differently. There is a middle route: **ISP proxies** (sometimes called static residential) – these are IPs from ISPs but reserved for your use (not rotated). They cost more than datacenter but less than fully rotating residential in bulk. For example, Smartproxy offers static residential IPs at a few dollars per IP per month ([Static Residential Proxy (ISP Proxies) Pricing - Free Trial - Smartproxy](https://smartproxy.com/proxies/isp-proxies/pricing#:~:text=Static%20Residential%20Proxy%20,%C2%B7%20%242.75)). One could obtain say 5 UK ISP IPs at ~$15–$20 total and assign browsers to use those. They have the legitimacy of residential IPs and if you don’t burn them too fast, they might persist. However, if any IP gets banned, you’d have to replace it manually. Rotating services are more automated. For simplicity, we’ll budget for rotating residential proxies.  

- **CAPTCHA Solving:** With a browser, you will encounter interactive CAPTCHAs (e.g., image selection). Services like 2Captcha can still solve those (they have a way to inject answers via browser APIs). Another approach is **automatic puzzle solving** via third-party libraries or even browser automation (for simpler CAPTCHAs like slider puzzles, some scripts can solve). Generally, plan to use the same 2Captcha solution, but integration in headless mode might be a bit more involved (waiting on a solve while the browser page is open). The cost remains small (maybe a bit more if more CAPTCHAs occur due to aggressive scraping). Let’s estimate **$10/month** on CAPTCHAs, as heavy JS sites might throw more challenges. 

- **Pros:** This option maximizes **scraping accuracy and completeness**. By using a real browser, you won’t miss data that is loaded dynamically, and you can emulate complex interactions (clicking “show contact” buttons, logging in, etc.). It’s a unified solution – essentially, if it works for one site, adding another just means writing a new script but using the same method. It might handle future changes in site design better (since you’re not parsing HTML with brittle assumptions, but rather using browser DOM queries which tend to be a bit more adaptable). Also, for compliance/detectability: a properly configured browser with residential IP and human-like delays has the **best chance of evading detection** short of being an actual human. This is important for LinkedIn/Facebook – indeed, lesser setups often fail as LinkedIn is noted to immediately flag automated scraping attempts ([Top 8 LinkedIn Proxies in 2025: Analyzed Features & Pricing](https://research.aimultiple.com/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=We%20tried%20various%20proxies%20to,that%20we%20used)). Option 2, if done carefully, gives the highest success on those platforms (though nothing is guaranteed – LinkedIn might still challenge logins or flag unusual browsing patterns, but you have more tools to appear human).  
- **Cons:** **Higher cost** – both infrastructure and proxies. Roughly, this could be double the cost of Option 1. Also, **slower** – doing everything through a browser means fewer pages per minute. If the 40k records were needed quickly, this would be an issue, but since it’s monthly, one browser instance (with some parallelism overnight) can likely keep up. Another con is maintenance: running full browsers is more error-prone (crashes, memory leaks). You’ll need to ensure the automation scripts handle timeouts, page crashes, and restart the browser as needed. The development of browser scripts for each site might actually be more straightforward than Scrapy parsing, but debugging them can be tricky. Lastly, this approach might still struggle with LinkedIn if not extremely careful – e.g., you might need to incorporate an **anti-detect browser** environment. Some companies use tools like **Multilogin** or **VMLogin** (which are paid tools to manage multiple browser profiles with canvas fingerprinting control, etc.) to further reduce detection. Those tools, however, have licensing fees (Multilogin starts around $120/month), which goes against our cost-saving priority. Instead, one can manually configure Playwright to randomize fingerprints or use open-source anti-detect scripts, but it’s an arms race with platforms.

**Estimated Monthly Cost (Option 2):**  
- Larger server or multiple small servers: **$50–$80** (cloud cost).  
- Residential proxy network: **$100–$150** (to cover 40k requests comfortably) – possibly lower if using traffic-based billing and pages aren’t heavy.  
- CAPTCHA solving: **$10** (higher side).  
- **Total: ≈ $160–$240/month** (approximately **$5+ per 1k records**).  

This is a significant cost increase over Option 1, but still far cheaper per record than most managed data services. It focuses spending where it’s needed (proxies, compute) to maximize the chance of successful scrapes on all targets.

### Option 3: **Hybrid & Distributed Approach (Balanced)**  
This approach essentially combines Option 1 and 2, tailoring the method to each source to balance cost and effectiveness. In practice, it means **using Scrapy+datacenter proxies for the easy websites** and **Puppeteer/Playwright+residential proxies for the difficult websites**. We’ve implicitly discussed this in Option 1, but here we formalize it as a strategy since it likely is the optimal recommendation.

- **Implementation:** Maintain two scraping systems: (a) a Scrapy crawler that handles sites like 192.com, 118, Cylex, Yell, etc., and (b) a headless browser automation for sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram. They can run in parallel, possibly on the same server or different servers, depending on resource needs. For instance, a low-cost VM could run the Scrapy spider continuously (since that is lightweight), while a second VM (with more RAM/CPU) runs the browser-based scrapers. The data from both can be combined in a final database or output, so the user sees one unified dataset. This distributed design allows you to not “overkill” the simpler tasks with an expensive method. 

- **Resource Allocation:** The Scrapy portion could run on a very cheap instance (even a $5–$10 per month tier) because parsing HTML and making requests is not CPU intensive. Meanwhile, the headless portion could use a moderate instance ($20–$40 range) because it will handle fewer total records (only those from social media) – e.g., if out of 40k records, perhaps 5k are from LinkedIn and 5k from Facebook/Instagram combined, that’s 10k headless navigations per month, which is much lighter. So you might split the workload: one machine for crawling directories, another for scraping social. Alternatively, run them on one larger machine but cap concurrency such that Scrapy doesn’t interfere with the browser’s CPU needs.  

- **Proxies:** Configure two proxy pools as described. For example:
  - Scrapy spiders use **datacenter proxies** (UK IPs) from provider A. This could cost around $50 (maybe a slightly smaller plan since they won’t use all 200k requests if only doing ~30k of the 40k records).
  - Headless scrapers use **residential proxies** from provider B, perhaps a usage-based plan. If only 10k requests go through residential, the bandwidth might be ~2–3 GB, costing maybe $10–$20, or a small plan of $50 with plenty of headroom. Even if we take a higher estimate of $75, it’s still not bad.
  
- **Accuracy:** The hybrid ensures that simpler sites (which likely don’t need a full browser) are scraped quickly and cheaply, and the complex sites get the full browser treatment to maximize success. Compliance-wise, you still need to be careful with the social sites portion (all the same anti-detection techniques from Option 2 apply). The directories portion is relatively low risk – e.g., scraping business contact info from Cylex or 118 should not trigger as many alarms or legal concerns as scraping personal data from social profiles.

- **Pros:** **Optimized costs** – you spend money only where necessary. This approach could potentially bring the total cost closer to Option 1’s level, depending on the mix of targets. If social profiles are a minority, the expensive resources are only used sparingly. It also offers **flexibility**: you can adjust each component independently (e.g., if LinkedIn proves too costly or difficult, you can decide to reduce that effort without affecting the other scrapers). From a development standpoint, you can use the best tool for each job rather than a one-size-fits-all.  
- **Cons:** It is the most **complex to maintain**, since you effectively have two systems. Monitoring and coordinating the scrapers might require additional work (ensuring one doesn’t overload proxies, combining output data, etc.). If you’re comfortable with coding, this trade-off is usually manageable. Another con is potential underutilization – paying for two servers and two proxy pools might sometimes mean neither is used at 100% capacity. But given the low absolute costs of small servers, the impact is minor.

**Estimated Monthly Cost (Option 3):**  
- Scrapy server: **$10** (for a small VM).  
- Headless server: **$30** (for a medium VM).  
- Datacenter proxies: **$50** (slightly scaled-down plan).  
- Residential proxies: **$50** (assuming lighter use for social scraping).  
- CAPTCHA solving: **$5**.  
- **Total: ≈ $145/month**. *(Could be lower if social scraping volume is low, or higher if social scraping ends up needing more resources.)* 

In practice, this is similar to Option 1’s cost, with a buffer for handling the tricky sites. It aims to stay under ~$150/month while covering all target types.

## Compliance and Detectability Considerations  
Scraping the data in question (especially personal contact details) raises compliance questions:

- **Platform Terms of Service:** Sites like LinkedIn and Facebook explicitly forbid scraping. LinkedIn in particular has taken legal action against scrapers in the past (e.g., the **hiQ Labs vs. LinkedIn** case in the US). While the legal landscape is evolving (scraping publicly available data was deemed not a violation of anti-hacking laws in that case), it still violates LinkedIn’s user agreement and they actively deploy technical blocks ([Top 8 LinkedIn Proxies in 2025: Analyzed Features & Pricing](https://research.aimultiple.com/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=providers%20such%20as%20Bright%20Data,users%20can%20access%20the%20site)) ([Top 8 LinkedIn Proxies in 2025: Analyzed Features & Pricing](https://research.aimultiple.com/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=program%20repetitive%20actions%20%28e,against%20LinkedIn%E2%80%99s%20Terms%20of%20Use)). Facebook/Instagram similarly disallow automated data collection. **What this means:** The user should proceed knowing accounts could be banned or legal notices could be issued if detected. Keeping the scraping to **internal research** mitigates some risk (no resale or publication of the data), but it doesn’t make it TOS-compliant. It’s wise to use dummy accounts (not anyone’s primary personal account) for any logged-in scraping, and avoid excessive scraping that might draw attention.  

- **Data Privacy (UK/GDPR):** Since UK is governed by UK-GDPR, any collection of personal data (names, emails, phones linked to individuals) requires a lawful basis for processing. If this is purely for research and testing, it might fall under legitimate interests, but if the data includes private contact info, it’s sensitive. Public business contact information (like a company’s contact page) is less an issue. **Recommendation:** Focus on scraping data that is publicly available and not behind privacy settings. For example, scraping a company’s Facebook page for an email it posted is generally fine; scraping users’ private info or friends-only data is not. Ensure data is stored securely and don’t keep it longer than needed. In a joint statement, UK regulators have put the onus on social media companies to prevent unlawful scraping ([Joint statement on data scraping and data protection | ICO](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/08/joint-statement-on-data-scraping-and-data-protection/#:~:text=Joint%20statement%20on%20data%20scraping,data%20from%20unlawful%20data%20scraping)), but scrapers themselves should also be cautious. If any scraped data is to be used beyond testing, consider anonymizing or obtaining consent as required.  

- **Detectability & Throttling:** Even with all technical precautions, assume that **LinkedIn will detect scraping quickly**. Research found LinkedIn would flag and block even residential IP sessions on the first page load in some cases ([Top 8 LinkedIn Proxies in 2025: Analyzed Features & Pricing](https://research.aimultiple.com/linkedin-proxies/#:~:text=We%20tried%20various%20proxies%20to,that%20we%20used)). This means you should be prepared for a cat-and-mouse game: you might need to **slow down requests significantly** (e.g. only a few profiles per account per hour), use many accounts, or periodically pause scraping to let things cool down. For Facebook, avoid actions that look non-human (like viewing hundreds of profiles without pauses). For sites like 192.com and 118, watch out for usage limits – they might start requiring logins or showing CAPTCHA after X queries from one IP. Adjust the scraper to recognize these signals and rotate IP or wait as needed.  

- **Legal Safe Practices:** Scrape only what a normal user could manually access. Do not attempt to circumvent login-required pages that you do not have credentials for (that could be considered unauthorized access). Obey robots.txt where feasible (though not legally binding in UK, it’s good practice). Since this is internal, you likely don’t need to worry about copyright of data, but if data is re-used, remember that large-scale copying of certain directories might breach database rights or terms. Some directories sell access to their data; scraping them might violate those terms. Again, if purely internal and limited scale, risk is lower. 

In summary, **LinkedIn and Facebook are the highest risk** both for detection and compliance. If the contact data from those can be obtained from alternative sources (for example, perhaps LinkedIn profile emails are often listed on a company website that you can scrape legally), consider that route to reduce reliance on scraping the platforms directly. But if not, ensure the scraping on those platforms is low-profile: use realistic user agents, solve challenges presented (CAPTCHAs), and respect the implicit rate limits (the tools should never behave like a denial-of-service attack). 

## Deployment Suggestions  
To implement the above solutions, here are a few practical deployment tips:

- **Cloud Provider:** Using a cloud VM in a UK region (London region of AWS, Azure, or a UK-based provider) can improve latency to target sites and ensure your own base IP is UK-local (for any traffic not sent through proxies). AWS is a solid choice for flexibility (and you can autoscale if needed). DigitalOcean or Linode offer simpler fixed-cost VMs which might suffice. For instance, you could deploy Option 3 with one Droplet at £8 and another at £20, etc. If you anticipate scaling up or down frequently, AWS EC2 with auto-scaling groups (or AWS Fargate/ECS for containers) could be considered, but for ~40k/month scale, a static setup is easier.  

- **Automation & Orchestration:** Use a scheduler (cron or a simple task queue) to spread the scraping jobs throughout the month rather than all at once. This reduces load on targets and proxies. For example, scrape a few thousand records each day. You could break tasks by region or surname initial for directories to distribute evenly. If using Scrapy, take advantage of its built-in scheduling (Scrapy can be run as a service or via a cronjob invoking different spiders). If using headless scripts, you might use a process manager like PM2 or a simple loop in a screen/tmux session to keep them running.  

- **Monitoring:** Include logging in your scrapers to track request success rates, response codes, and frequencies of CAPTCHAs or bans. If a certain site starts blocking too much, you might dial back the frequency or tweak the proxy strategy. Open-source tools like Grafana/Prometheus could ingest logs for monitoring, but a simpler approach is to log to files and review them periodically.  

- **Data Storage:** After scraping, you’ll accumulate the contact records. Ensure you store them securely (since personal data is involved). Even for internal use, restrict access to the data. Consider summarizing or anonymizing if it’s just for analysis. For 40k records, even a CSV or SQLite database is fine; if you prefer, use a proper database like PostgreSQL if the data will be queried.  

- **Updates and Maintenance:** Websites change frequently. Plan to update the scrapers whenever you notice a drop in success or a layout change. Keeping the scrapers modular will help (e.g., each spider or script in its own file, easy to edit). Also, maintain your proxy subscriptions – ensure the pools remain healthy (some cheap providers might have unstable proxy pools, so be ready to switch if needed; many offer free trials to test).  

## Conclusion & Recommendation  
For the user’s use case (internal research on UK contact data), the **cheapest viable solution** is to adopt a **hybrid scraping architecture** that uses simple, cost-saving techniques for most targets and only leverages heavy-duty measures for the particularly tough sites. Specifically, **Option 3 (Hybrid)** is recommended: 

- Use **Scrapy or an equivalent fast crawler** with **rotating datacenter proxies** to gather data from public directories like 192.com, 118, Cylex, etc. This will handle the bulk of the ~40k records at a very low cost per record. 
- In parallel, use a **headless browser (Playwright)** with **residential proxies** to carefully scrape data from **LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram**, and similar platforms that have strong anti-scraping defenses. Run these slower and during off-peak hours to minimize detection. 
- Employ a **CAPTCHA-solving service** as needed, and incorporate all the anti-bot tactics (dynamic delays, user agent spoofing, etc.) to stay under the radar. 

This combination keeps monthly costs roughly in the $100–$150 range while maximizing the chances of retrieving the needed contact details. By contrast, an all-headless approach could double the cost, and an all-Scrapy approach might fail on critical data from social sites. The recommended solution cherry-picks the strengths of each approach.

**Cost Summary:** With the hybrid approach, expect to spend on the order of **£80–£120 per month** (around **$100–$150**) when factoring in a cloud VM (~£20-£30), proxies (~£50-£80 total for mixed type) and CAPTCHA services (a few pounds). This works out to only a few pence per record, which is highly cost-effective compared to purchasing data or using premium APIs. For example, even Bright Data’s automated LinkedIn API, while convenient, starts at ~$0.001 per record ([LinkedIn Scraper - Free Trial](https://brightdata.com/products/web-scraper/linkedin#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20specific%20usage,for%20your%20web%20scraping%20projects)) (which would be ~$40 for 40k records) **plus** proxy fees – and our solution remains within the same order of magnitude cost while granting full control to the user.

In terms of **pros/cons**: the cheapest solution does require more hands-on management and respect for scraping ethics. But given it’s for internal use, the flexibility and low cost justify this. Table 2 provides a final comparison of the options:

| **Setup Option**        | **Est. Monthly Cost** | **Pros**                                | **Cons**                              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **1. Scrapy-Centric**   | ~$120                | Lowest cost, fast for static sites, uses minimal resources ([Scrapy vs Puppeteer: Which One to Choose? - ZenRows](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/scrapy-vs-puppeteer#:~:text=Browser%20None%20Headless%20Chrome%20Avoid,Consumes%20more%20memory%20than%20Scrapy)). | Struggles with dynamic sites (LinkedIn, etc.), more dev effort to integrate JS rendering. |
| **2.

| **3. Hybrid (Recommended)** | ~$140          | Best cost/accuracy balance – cheap for easy parts, robust for hard parts. | Most complex (two systems to maintain), requires tuning per site. |

*Table 2: Comparison of scraping setups.*  

Ultimately, for a **40k/month internal scraping project in the UK**, a carefully managed self-hosted pipeline can be achieved very cost-effectively. By leveraging open-source tools (Scrapy, Playwright), commodity proxy services, and good scraping practices, the user can avoid expensive managed solutions while still obtaining the contact data needed. Just remember that with great scraping power comes great responsibility – always scrape politely, in compliance with laws, and within reasonable limits to ensure long-term feasibility of the project.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What We Discovered:

1. ‚úÖ **Flat 1-3 West Gate mystery SOLVED**
   - Properties ARE in PayProp (for invoicing)
   - Actual rent receipts in historical_transactions (not PayProp)
   - Commission calculated from PayProp invoices
   - **Hybrid setup:** PayProp invoicing + Historical receipts

2. ‚úÖ **ICDN Should Be Excluded from Unified Data**
   - ICDN = Invoices (what's billed), not cash flow (what's received)
   - Code updated to exclude ICDN_ACTUAL from unified_transactions
   - Cleanup SQL created: `cleanup_icdn_from_unified.sql`

3. ‚úÖ **Incoming Payments Totals**
   - PayProp: ¬£88,560.39 (106 payments, Jun-Oct 2025)
   - Historical: ¬£104,968.00 (135 payments, Jan-Sep 2025)
   - **Combined: ¬£193,528.39** (241 payments)

4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **System vs Your Records - 99.7% Match**
   - Your total: ¬£181,174
   - System total: ¬£180,648
   - Variance: -¬£526 (0.3%)
   - **BUT**: 4 major anomalies identified that need investigation

### Key Files Created:

1. `DATA_SOURCES_EXPLAINED.md` - Complete table structure guide
2. `EXCLUDE_ICDN_FROM_UNIFIED_DATA.md` - ICDN exclusion implementation
3. `INCOMING_PAYMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - All incoming payment analysis
4. `FLAT1_3WESTGATE_COMMISSION_MYSTERY_SOLVED.md` - Mystery resolution
5. `cleanup_icdn_from_unified.sql` - SQL to remove ICDN data

## THE ORIGINAL MYSTERY

### User Statement:
"Financial transactions shows a commission amount for Flat 1, 2, 3 - 3 West Gate when the property has only had incoming transactions in historical transactions. Why?"

### The Problem:
- User believed these properties were NEVER on PayProp
- Only had historical incoming payment data
- But system showed commission charges
- Where was commission coming from?

### Investigation Files:
- `InvestigateFlat1Data.java`
- `TraceCommissionSource.java`
- `TracePhantomData.java`
- `CheckWestGateProperty.java`

## DATABASE STRUCTURE

### Tables Overview:

#### LOCAL TABLES (Your Database)

| Table | Purpose | Row Count | Key Fields |
|-------|---------|-----------|------------|
| **properties** | Property master list | ~60 | id, property_name, payprop_id |
| **invoices** | Lease agreements (rent amounts) | ~60 | id, payprop_id, lease_reference, amount |
| **customers** | Tenants and property owners | Varies | customer_id, name, type |
| **historical_transactions** | Pre-PayProp CSV imports | ~176 | id, category, amount, transaction_date |
| **financial_transactions** | PayProp synced data | 629 | id, data_source, amount, pay_prop_transaction_id |
| **unified_transactions** | Materialized view (rebuilt) | 571 | source_system, payprop_data_source |

#### PAYPROP EXPORT TABLES (From PayProp API)

| Table | Purpose | Row Count | What It Contains |
|-------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **payprop_export_properties** | PayProp property master | 45 | Property setup, addresses |
| **payprop_export_invoices** | Invoice INSTRUCTIONS (templates) | 34 | "Create ¬£795 invoice monthly" |
| **payprop_export_payments** | Payment RULES (distribution) | 66 | "Pay landlord 100%, commission 15%" |
| **payprop_export_incoming_payments** | ACTUAL rent received | 106 | Real tenant payments |
| **payprop_report_icdn** | ACTUAL invoices created | 172 | Individual bills sent to tenants |
| **payprop_report_all_payments** | ACTUAL disbursements | 202 | Money paid to landlords |
| **payprop_export_tenants** | Tenant master list | 42 | Tenant details |
| **payprop_export_beneficiaries** | Payment recipients | 8 | Who receives money |

### The Three Types of "Invoices"

**IMPORTANT:** Don't confuse these three different meanings:

1. **`invoices` table** = **Lease agreements** (your local database)
   - "Tenant pays ¬£795/month for this property"
   - Setup once, defines ongoing rent
   - Example: `LEASE-BH-F1-2025`, ¬£795/month

2. **`payprop_export_invoices`** = **Invoice templates/instructions** (from PayProp)
   - "Create a ¬£795 invoice every month for tenant X"
   - Configuration for recurring billing
   - These are RULES, not actual invoices

3. **`payprop_report_icdn`** = **Actual invoices created** (from PayProp)
   - "Invoice #yJ66DlrkJj for ¬£795 sent on July 4, 2025"
   - Individual bills actually sent to tenants each month
   - **ICDN = Invoice, Credit note, Debit note**

---

## DATA SOURCES FEEDING UNIFIED TRANSACTIONS

### Current Implementation (BEFORE our changes):

```
unified_transactions gets data from:

1. historical_transactions
   - WHERE invoice_id IS NOT NULL
   - All records with lease linkage

2. financial_transactions
   - WHERE invoice_id IS NOT NULL
   - AND data_source NOT IN ('HISTORICAL_IMPORT', 'HISTORICAL_CSV')
   - Includes: INCOMING_PAYMENT, BATCH_PAYMENT, COMMISSION_PAYMENT, ICDN_ACTUAL
```

### Updated Implementation (AFTER our changes):

```
unified_transactions gets data from:

1. historical_transactions
   - WHERE invoice_id IS NOT NULL
   - [No change]

2. financial_transactions
   - WHERE invoice_id IS NOT NULL
   - AND data_source NOT IN ('HISTORICAL_IMPORT', 'HISTORICAL_CSV', 'ICDN_ACTUAL')
   - Includes: INCOMING_PAYMENT, BATCH_PAYMENT, COMMISSION_PAYMENT
   - EXCLUDES: ICDN_ACTUAL (invoices - not cash flow)
```

**File changed:** `UnifiedTransactionRebuildService.java` (lines 175 & 331)

### Data Source Breakdown:

#### financial_transactions data_source values:

| Data Source | Type | Count | Total | Include in Unified? |
|------------|------|-------|-------|---------------------|
| **INCOMING_PAYMENT** | Rent received from tenants | 106 | ¬£88,560 | ‚úÖ YES |
| **BATCH_PAYMENT** | Money paid to landlords | 202 | ¬£84,585 | ‚úÖ YES |
| **COMMISSION_PAYMENT** | Management fees charged | 134 | ¬£14,002 | ‚úÖ YES |
| **ICDN_ACTUAL** | Invoices sent (bills) | 187 | ¬£133,145 | ‚ùå **NO (excluded)** |
| **HISTORICAL_IMPORT** | Duplicates historical | - | - | ‚ùå NO |
| **HISTORICAL_CSV** | Duplicates historical | - | - | ‚ùå NO |

#### historical_transactions category values:

| Category | Type | Count | Total | Include in Unified? |
|----------|------|-------|-------|---------------------|
| **rent** | Rent received (positive) | 135 | ¬£104,968 | ‚úÖ YES (if invoice_id linked) |
| owner_payment | Paid to owners (negative) | 13 | -¬£79,185 | Depends on invoice_id |
| furnishings | Expenses | 8 | -¬£1,530 | Depends on invoice_id |
| cleaning | Expenses | 7 | -¬£1,400 | Depends on invoice_id |
| management | Fees | 5 | -¬£880 | Depends on invoice_id |
| utilities | Bills | 2 | -¬£288 | Depends on invoice_id |

**Note:** historical_transactions uses `category = 'rent'` to identify incoming payments, NOT `transaction_type`.

## THE FLAT 1-3 WEST GATE MYSTERY - SOLVED

### The Facts:

**Flat 1 - 3 West Gate:**
- PayProp Property ID: `KAXNvEqAXk`
- Monthly rent: ¬£795
- Status: Active in PayProp
- Last synced: 2025-10-30 10:30:20

**Flat 2 - 3 West Gate:**
- PayProp Property ID: `KAXNvEqVXk`
- Monthly rent: ¬£740
- Status: Active in PayProp

**Flat 3 - 3 West Gate:**
- PayProp Property ID: `WzJBQ3ERZQ`
- Monthly rent: ¬£740
- Status: Active in PayProp

### What We Found in Each Table:

#### ‚úÖ payprop_export_properties (Master List)
```
Flat 1: EXISTS (KAXNvEqAXk)
- is_archived: 0 (active)
- commission_percentage: 15%
- imported_at: 2025-10-30 10:29:55 (TODAY!)
```

#### ‚úÖ payprop_report_icdn (Invoices Created)
```
Flat 1: 7 invoices (¬£5,565 total)
- Monthly ¬£795 invoices (Jul-Oct 2025)
- Some credit notes (reversals)
```

#### ‚úÖ payprop_export_payments (Payment Rules)
```
Flat 1 has 2 payment rules:
1. Pay 100% to landlord (Udayan Bhardwaj)
2. Charge 15% commission to Propsk
```

#### ‚ùå payprop_export_incoming_payments (Actual Receipts)
```
Flat 1: ZERO records
Flat 2: ZERO records
Flat 3: ZERO records
```

#### ‚úÖ historical_transactions (Your CSV Imports)
```
Flat 1: 7 payments (¬£5,565 total, Jan-Sep 2025)
Flat 2: 6 payments (¬£4,440 total, Jan-Aug 2025)
Flat 3: 6 payments (¬£4,440 total, Jan-Sep 2025)
```

### The Answer:

**These properties ARE on PayProp - but in a HYBRID setup:**

1. **PayProp manages:** Invoicing (bills sent to tenants)
2. **Historical manages:** Actual rent receipts (payments received)
3. **Commission calculated:** From PayProp invoices (15% of ¬£795 = ¬£119.25)

**Why this happened:**
- Properties added to PayProp mid-2025 for invoicing
- PayProp started creating monthly invoices
- But actual rent receipts still tracked in historical system (CSV imports)
- PayProp calculates commission from invoices, NOT receipts
- Result: Commission appears without PayProp receipt data

**Local property table confirms:**
```
payprop_manages_financials: FALSE
financial_tracking_source: PAYPROP
```

This means PayProp does invoicing, but not full financial tracking.

## ICDN EXCLUSION DECISION

### Why Exclude ICDN from Unified Transactions?

**ICDN = Invoice, Credit note, Debit note**

These represent:
- ‚ùå Bills SENT to tenants (what they OWE)
- ‚ùå NOT money actually received
- ‚ùå NOT cash flow

**Including ICDN causes:**
- Double-counting (invoice + payment = 2x income)
- Inflated financial totals
- Confusion between billed vs collected

### The Numbers:

**Current unified_transactions (WITH ICDN):**
- ICDN_ACTUAL: 163 records, ¬£112,909
- INCOMING_PAYMENT: ~106 records, ¬£88,560
- BATCH_PAYMENT: 152 records, ¬£63,594
- COMMISSION_PAYMENT: 118 records, ¬£12,432
- **Total PayProp: 539 records, ¬£277,495**

**After ICDN exclusion (WITHOUT ICDN):**
- INCOMING_PAYMENT: 106 records, ¬£88,560
- BATCH_PAYMENT: 152 records, ¬£63,594
- COMMISSION_PAYMENT: 118 records, ¬£12,432
- **Total PayProp: 376 records, ¬£164,586**

**Impact:** Removes ¬£112,909 in invoice data (41% reduction in PayProp totals)

### Code Changes Made:

**File:** `src/main/java/site/easy/to/build/crm/service/transaction/UnifiedTransactionRebuildService.java`

**Lines 175 and 331:**
```java
// BEFORE:
WHERE ft.data_source NOT IN ('HISTORICAL_IMPORT', 'HISTORICAL_CSV')

// AFTER:
WHERE ft.data_source NOT IN ('HISTORICAL_IMPORT', 'HISTORICAL_CSV', 'ICDN_ACTUAL')
```

### Cleanup Required:

**Run this SQL to remove existing ICDN data:**
```sql
DELETE FROM unified_transactions
WHERE payprop_data_source = 'ICDN_ACTUAL';
```

Expected to remove: 163 records (¬£112,909)

**File:** `cleanup_icdn_from_unified.sql` (ready to execute)

## MAJOR ANOMALIES IDENTIFIED

### 1. üö® **Flat 12 - 3 West Gate: ¬£5,687.30 Payment** (Aug 8, 2025)

**THE SMOKING GUN**

- Normal rent for Flat 12: ~¬£675-¬£795/month
- Actual payment recorded: **¬£5,687.30**
- This is **7.6x normal monthly rent**
- Accounts for most of August's ¬£15,789 variance

**Possible explanations:**
- ‚ùì Back-payment for 7-8 months
- ‚ùì Deposit + advance rent lump sum
- ‚ùì **Data entry error** (should be ¬£568.73?)
- ‚ùì **Duplicate payment** recorded multiple times
- ‚ùì Decimal point error (¬£5687.30 vs ¬£568.73)

**Transaction details:**
```
Date: 2025-08-08
Property: Flat 12 - 3 West Gate
Amount: ¬£5,687.30
Source: financial_transactions (PayProp)
Data Source: INCOMING_PAYMENT
```

**URGENT:** This needs investigation to determine if legitimate or error.

---

### 2. üö® **July - Missing ¬£10,155 in PayProp**

**Your records:** ¬£15,130 in PayProp
**System shows:** ¬£4,975 in PayProp

**System only captured 6 payments:**
1. Apartment F - Knighton Hayes Manor: ¬£1,125
2. Apartment 40 - 31 Watkin Road: ¬£900
3. Flat 24 - 3 West Gate: ¬£810
4. Flat 5 - 3 West Gate: ¬£740
5. Flat 7 - 3 West Gate: ¬£700
6. Flat 17 - 3 West Gate: ¬£700
**Total: ¬£4,975**

**Missing: ~12-15 properties** worth of rent (¬£10,155)

**Likely cause:**
- PayProp sync incomplete for June 22 - July 21 period
- Transition period where properties were moving to PayProp
- Data import gap

---

### 3. üö® **October - Missing ¬£10,146 Total**

**Your records:**
- Old Account: ¬£6,735
- PayProp: ¬£19,516
- Total: ¬£26,251

**System shows:**
- Old Account: ¬£0 (no historical after Sep 15)
- PayProp: ¬£16,105
- Total: ¬£16,105

**Gaps identified:**
1. **Historical missing ¬£6,735** - No historical transactions imported for Sept 22 - Oct 21
2. **PayProp missing ¬£3,411** - System has ¬£16,105 vs your ¬£19,516

**Cause:**
- Historical data import stopped after Sep 15
- PayProp incomplete for this period

---

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **June - Missing ¬£2,950 in PayProp**

**Your records:** ¬£3,690 in PayProp
**System shows:** ¬£740 in PayProp (only 1 property: Flat 15)

**Missing:** ¬£2,950 worth of PayProp payments (~4 properties)

**This is a transition period** - some properties may have been switching to PayProp.

---

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **April & September - Small Gaps**

**April:**
- Your: ¬£20,470
- System: ¬£19,730
- Missing: ¬£740 (exactly 1 month's rent for a property)

**September:**
- Historical missing: ¬£740
- PayProp extra: ¬£8,416
- Could be timing differences

-- Get full transaction details
SELECT
    id,
    pay_prop_transaction_id,
    transaction_date,
    amount,
    property_name,
    tenant_name,
    description,
    reference,
    created_at,
    updated_at,
    data_source
FROM financial_transactions
WHERE property_name = 'Flat 12 - 3 West Gate'
  AND transaction_date = '2025-08-08'
  AND amount = 5687.30;

-- Check for nearby transactions
SELECT
    transaction_date,
    amount,
    description
FROM financial_transactions
WHERE property_name = 'Flat 12 - 3 West Gate'
  AND transaction_date BETWEEN '2025-07-01' AND '2025-09-30'
ORDER BY transaction_date;

-- Check historical for Flat 12
SELECT
    transaction_date,
    amount,
    description
FROM historical_transactions ht
LEFT JOIN properties p ON ht.property_id = p.id
WHERE p.property_name = 'Flat 12 - 3 West Gate'
ORDER BY transaction_date DESC;
```

### HIGH PRIORITY - Fix Missing Data:

#### 1. Import Missing July PayProp Data (¬£10,155)

**Period:** June 22 - July 21, 2025

**Check what should be there:**
```sql
-- Check PayProp export for this period
SELECT
    property_name,
    transaction_date,
    amount
FROM payprop_export_incoming_payments
WHERE transaction_date BETWEEN '2025-06-22' AND '2025-07-21'
ORDER BY transaction_date;

-- Compare to what's in financial_transactions
SELECT
    property_name,
    transaction_date,
    amount
FROM financial_transactions
WHERE data_source = 'INCOMING_PAYMENT'
  AND transaction_date BETWEEN '2025-06-22' AND '2025-07-21'
ORDER BY transaction_date;
```

#### 2. Import Missing October Historical Data (¬£6,735)

**Period:** Sept 22 - Oct 21, 2025

```sql
-- Check if data exists but isn't in category='rent'
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(amount) as total
FROM historical_transactions
WHERE transaction_date BETWEEN '2025-09-22' AND '2025-10-21'
GROUP BY category;

-- Check last import date
SELECT
    MAX(transaction_date) as last_transaction,
    MAX(created_at) as last_import
FROM historical_transactions
WHERE category = 'rent';
```

#### 3. Investigate Missing October PayProp Data (¬£3,411)

**Period:** Sept 22 - Oct 21, 2025

```sql
-- Count properties that paid in October
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT property_name) as property_count,
    SUM(amount) as total
FROM financial_transactions
WHERE data_source = 'INCOMING_PAYMENT'
  AND transaction_date BETWEEN '2025-09-22' AND '2025-10-21';

-- Compare to previous months
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(transaction_date, '%Y-%m') as month,
    COUNT(*) as payment_count,
    SUM(amount) as total
FROM financial_transactions
WHERE data_source = 'INCOMING_PAYMENT'
  AND transaction_date >= '2025-06-01'
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(transaction_date, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY month;
```

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Execute ICDN Cleanup:

```sql
-- Preview
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as records_to_delete,
    SUM(amount) as total_amount
FROM unified_transactions
WHERE payprop_data_source = 'ICDN_ACTUAL';

-- Execute
DELETE FROM unified_transactions
WHERE payprop_data_source = 'ICDN_ACTUAL';

-- Verify
SELECT
    payprop_data_source,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM unified_transactions
GROUP BY payprop_data_source;
```

### LOW PRIORITY - Rebuild Unified Transactions:

After fixing data issues and removing ICDN:

```sql
-- Via API or service
POST /api/admin/unified/rebuild

-- Or via Java
unifiedTransactionRebuildService.rebuildComplete();
```

## SQL QUERIES FOR INVESTIGATION

### Quick Health Check:

```sql
-- Total incoming by period (your custom 22nd-21st)
SELECT
    'Historical' as source,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(amount) as total
FROM historical_transactions
WHERE category = 'rent' AND amount > 0
  AND transaction_date BETWEEN '2024-12-22' AND '2025-10-21'
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'PayProp' as source,
    COUNT(*) as count,

FROM historical_transactions ht
LEFT JOIN properties p ON ht.property_id = p.id
WHERE category = 'rent'
  AND amount > 2000
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'PayProp' as source,
    transaction_date,
    property_name,
    amount
FROM financial_transactions
WHERE data_source = 'INCOMING_PAYMENT'
  AND amount > 2000
ORDER BY amount DESC;
```

### Check Data Source Breakdown:

```sql
-- financial_transactions by source
SELECT
    data_source,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(amount) as total,
    MIN(transaction_date) as earliest,
    MAX(transaction_date) as latest
FROM financial_transactions
GROUP BY data_source
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- historical_transactions by category
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(amount) as total
FROM historical_transactions
WHERE category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Verify Flat 1-3 West Gate Data:

```sql
-- PayProp ICDN (invoices)
SELECT
    property_name,
    COUNT(*) as invoice_count,
    SUM(amount) as total
FROM payprop_report_icdn
WHERE property_name IN ('Flat 1 - 3 West Gate', 'Flat 2 - 3 West Gate', 'Flat 3 - 3 West Gate')
GROUP BY property_name;

-- Historical receipts
SELECT
    p.property_name,
    COUNT(*) as payment_count,
    SUM(ht.amount) as total
FROM historical_transactions ht
LEFT JOIN properties p ON ht.property_id = p.id
WHERE p.property_name IN ('Flat 1 - 3 West Gate', 'Flat 2 - 3 West Gate', 'Flat 3 - 3 West Gate')
  AND ht.category = 'rent'
GROUP BY p.property_name;

-- Commission calculated
SELECT
    property_name,
    COUNT(*) as commission_count,
    SUM(amount) as total
FROM financial_transactions
WHERE property_name IN ('Flat 1 - 3 West Gate', 'Flat 2 - 3 West Gate', 'Flat 3 - 3 West Gate')
  AND data_source = 'COMMISSION_PAYMENT'
GROUP BY property_name;
```

## SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS

### What We Accomplished:

1. ‚úÖ Solved Flat 1-3 West Gate mystery (hybrid PayProp/Historical setup)
2. ‚úÖ Documented complete database structure
3. ‚úÖ Identified ICDN should be excluded from unified data
4. ‚úÖ Updated code to exclude ICDN from future rebuilds
5. ‚úÖ Analyzed all incoming payments (¬£193,528 total)
6. ‚úÖ Compared system vs your records (99.7% match)
7. ‚úÖ Identified 4 major data anomalies

### Critical Issues to Resolve:

1. **üö® URGENT:** Investigate Flat 12 ¬£5,687.30 payment (possible error)
2. **üö® HIGH:** Import missing July PayProp data (¬£10,155)
3. **üö® HIGH:** Import missing October data (¬£10,146)
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM:** Execute ICDN cleanup from unified_transactions

## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER WHEN YOU RESUME:

1. **Is the Flat 12 ¬£5,687.30 payment legitimate or an error?**
   - If error: What should it be?
   - If legitimate: What does it represent?

2. **Where is the missing July PayProp data?**
   - Was it imported but under different source?
   - Is it in payprop_export_incoming_payments but not financial_transactions?

3. **Why did historical data import stop at Sep 15?**
   - Need to import Sept 22 - Oct 21 period
   - Is there a CSV file that wasn't imported?

4. **Should we proceed with ICDN cleanup?**
   - Confirm it's safe to delete 163 ICDN records from unified
   - Understand impact on existing statements
